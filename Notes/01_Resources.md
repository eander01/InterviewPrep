# Resources

* Books
    * [Cracking the Coding Interview (CtCI)](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
        * Probably the most used and most referenced resource for good reason.
        * The author provides quick chapters that cover the essentials along with a wealth of practice problems.
        * The author additionally has a series of videos on Youtube done in collaboration with HackerRank.
            * [Data Structures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1t_8YX-Apv-UiRlnZwqqrRT8D1RhriX)
            * [Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLI1t_8YX-ApvMthLj56t1Rf-Buio5Y8KL)
    * [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322)
        * This book has had a huge impact on me even outside of this process.
        * Worth reading or at least grabbing key ideas from if you haven't ever considered a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset, or if you find yourself struggling with so-called imposter syndrome, feelings of insufficiency, anxiety, fear, etc.
* [LeetCode](https://www.leetcode.com)
    * In general I found LeetCode to be superior to other similar sites, both in terms of the quantity and quality of problems as well as the amount of discussion and size of the community.
    * HackerRank has very limited support for C#, which made a difference at least in my case.
* YouTube Channels
    * Some of these are better than others but I found them all useful and quality content at times.
    * Some of these can be click-bait-y.
    * Some of these can be kind of "brogrammer"

    * [An Algorithm for Passing Programming Interviews](https://malisper.me/an-algorithm-for-passing-programming-interviews/)

    * [System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
    * [What is Big O Notation](https://jarednielsen.com/big-o-notation/)
    
* IDE
    * In general the recommendation I followed and that I think makes the most sense is to solve problems on paper or a plain text editor as you won't be able to rely on IDE features in most actual interviews.
    * It is useful in some cases to be able to run tests against actual code and compile things, so figure out a setup that works for whatever language you are practicing in.
    * I had a Visual Studio solution available if I really needed to run some tests against something, but ended up using VS Code for most of my daily code practice and note-taking.
