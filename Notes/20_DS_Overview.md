# Data Structures

## Overview

* The goal is to be able to quickly identify the appropriate data structure(s) to solve a problem.
* Most languages have extensive library classes and functions available. In general these are fine to use, but be prepared to be able to talk about what they do, how they work, and their run-time. For the more simple DS, you may be asked to implement them yourself, so knowing how to put together a LinkedList, HashSet, or TreeNode is very helpful.
* Maps and Arrays probably make up some significant portion of most DS-based interview questions.

## Data Structure Toolbox

* Array / List
* Hash / Map / Dictionary
* LinkedList (singly or doubly)
* Stack / Queue
* Tree / Graph
